# mydb
This is a sort of database engine written in C I worked on, hoping to develop my C programming skills and to dive into database engine technology.
The core is represented by three source files, BPTREE.C, NODE.C and PAGER.C. 
BPTREE.C implements node insert, erase, search and traversing functions.
NODE.C implements node tyoes structures
